        Hi Adriele!
    </div>
    <div>
        This site may look ugly, but it's quick to set up!
        And as we all know, simplicity is the definition of elegance.
    </div>
    <h2> How to Use GitHub To Create Your Own Website Quickly!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Create a <a href="https://github.com/"> GitHub </a> account first if you haven't already </li>
        <li> If you have questions about how to use GitHub, just ask :) I recommend it
        <li> Go to <a href="https://pages.github.com/"> this GitHub page </a> for how to host basic websites off of GitHub </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
    	I didn't use any JavaScript (JS) to create this.
    	I made a more complex <a href="http://chriskrajewski.name">  personal website </a> using the React framework if you want to take a look
    </div>
    <div>
    	But let's take this one step at a time. This is a static site. Static sites don't need JS!
    </div>
    <div class="layout-blueBackground">
    	Until you learn JS, I recommend sticking to HTML and CSS. I used CSS to give this font a white color and blue background! 
    	<br />
    	And round corners. Because we all know round colors are the future.
