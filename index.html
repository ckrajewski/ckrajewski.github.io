        Hi Adriele! It's Chris. Check it out! I made an ugly website :)
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm using GitHub to host this page. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/ckrajewski/ckrajewski.github.io"> repo</a> I used to make this page.
        <br />
        <br />
        This site may look ugly, but it's quick to set up!
        And as we all know, simplicity is the definition of elegance.

    Where to go To Learn HTML CSS and JavaScript </h2>

        Check out <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/"> FreeCodeCamp. </a>
        <br />

        I recommend looking into HTML and CSS first. That's all I used to make this page, but you can make a page look way less ugly than this with some CSS.
        <br />
        You only need JavaScript (JS) to make dynamic webites. Static ones (ones that show the same shit all of the time) don't need JS.
        <br />

        Check out <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire Hathaway</a> to see what I mean. I multi-billion dollar company, and they didn't need JS haha

    <h2> How to Use GitHub To Create Your Own Website Quickly!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Create a <a href="https://github.com/"> GitHub </a> account first if you haven't already </li>
        <li> If you have questions about how to use GitHub, just ask :) I recommend it learning Git because a lot of people use it.
        <li> Go to <a href="https://pages.github.com/"> this GitHub page </a> for how to host basic websites off of GitHub </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        I didn't use any JavaScript (JS) to create this.
        I made a more complex <a href="http://chriskrajewski.name">  personal website </a> using the React framework if you want to take a look
    </div>
    <div>
        But let's take this one step at a time. This is a static site. Static sites don't need JS!
    </div>
    <div class="layout-blueBackground">
        Until you learn JS, I recommend sticking to HTML and CSS. I used CSS to give this font a white color and blue background!
        <br />
        And round corners. Because we all know round courners are the future.
